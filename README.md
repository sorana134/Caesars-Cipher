# Caesar Cipher Frequency Analysis App

## Overview

This C++ application analyzes a text encrypted using Caesar's cipher. It compares the frequency of each letter in the encrypted text with the standard frequency of letters in the English language. By the end of the analysis, the application determines both the key used for encryption and the deciphered text.

## Features

1. **Frequency Analysis:** The application performs frequency analysis on the encrypted text to determine the occurrence of each letter.

2. **Standard Frequency Comparison:** It compares the frequency of each letter in the encrypted text with the standard frequency of letters in the English language.

3. **Key Identification:** Based on the frequency analysis, the application identifies the key used for encryption.

4. **Text Deciphering:** Using the identified key, the application decrypts the text and provides the original, deciphered text.

## How to Use

1. **Input Encrypted Text:** Provide the encrypted text as input to the application.

2. **Run the Application:** Execute the program to initiate the frequency analysis and key identification process.

3. **View Results:** The application will display the identified key and the deciphered text.

Feel free to explore the application's functionalities and experiment with different encrypted texts. Happy deciphering!
